Just a little theme I built a few months ago by copying levelsio for fun to learn how making templates with Ghost works.

[Check the demo](https://makertheme.ronaldlangeveld.com)

Check out [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io) for the real legit one. This is just a blatant rip off - with a few custom things.

It's probably missing a few vital things, so maybe not production ready.

But anyway, I updated it this morning to make sure it works on Ghost 2.0 and later.. actually I think I screwed up the json and it will only work on ghost 2.0 and above anyway.

Just download as a zip and upload via Ghost.
Even better, fork it and use it as a base to make your own theme with your own style, etc.

It uses jQuery for a few things and [Bulma](https://bulma.io) to help keep it responsive, etc.

Peace
